ACS712 is a low budget curent sensor for Microcontrollers like Arduinos. The ACS712 is a bi-directional, Hall Effect current sensing IC. The current is passed through the IC; with little to no effect on the voltage, and the IC measure the magnetic field generated by the current. This is a breakout board for the fully integrated Hall Effect based linear ACS712 current sensor. The sensor gives precise current measurement for both AC and DC signals [13]. Thick copper conductor and signal traces allows for survival of the device up to 5 times overcurrent conditions.  The ACS712 outputs an analog voltage output signal that varies linearly with sensed current. The device requires 5VDC for VCC and a couple of filter capacitors.
